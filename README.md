# Implementation Semantic Loss based on mmdetection

## I. Quick-start on VNC ([based on example-annos](https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/bifold/dataloader/tree/master/coco_anno_examples5))
#### 1) Open the existed Anaconda-env:
```shell
source activate open-mmlab
```
#### 2.1). Train from the pre-saved images and annotations in the path ./mmdetection/data/CocoCust:
    ├── mmdetection
        |── data
            ├── CocoCust
                └── annotations
                └── coco
                └── fakeKitti
```shell
python tools/train.py configs/fcos/fcos_r50_caffe_fpn_gn-head_1x_coco_cust.py --gpus 1 --work-dir ./fcos_r50_fpn_gn_coco_cust
```

#### 2.2). Train from the pre-saved annotations and load images from other paths:
    ├── mmdetection
        |── data
            ├── CocoCust
                └── annotations
```shell
python tools/train.py configs/fcos/fcos_r50_caffe_fpn_gn-head_1x_coco_cust_loadFromSeparatedFile.py --gpus 1 --work-dir ./fcos_r50_fpn_gn_coco_cust
```
Here, the example-data already exists in this repo.  

***Note 1.***: As an example, train2017 is same to val2017 which will indicate how the model overfit our training-data.

***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.***: Here, 'workers_per_gpu' was set to 0. If more workers were set, if will occurs an out of shared memory ERROR due to a docker environment configuretion. 

#### 3) Visualization in Tensorboard:
```shell
tensorboard --logdir=./fcos_r50_fpn_gn_coco_cust/tf_logs/ --bind_all
```

#### 4) Visualize the training progress:
```shell
http://127.0.0.1:6006/
```

## II. Quick-start on Pinky ([based on example-annos](https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/bifold/dataloader/tree/master/coco_anno_examples5))
#### 1) Attch to the existed docker container:
```shell
docker attach mmdetection
```
#### 2) Other steps are same as on VNC:

***Note***: As an example, train2017 is same to val2017 which will indicate how the model overfit our training-data.
                       

## III.Below are mmdetection-toolbox Installation from [official repo](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
### Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation.

### Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection.
We provide [colab tutorial](demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb), and full guidance for quick run [with existing dataset](docs/1_exist_data_model.md) and [with new dataset](docs/2_new_data_model.md) for beginners.
There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/customize_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing models](docs/tutorials/customize_models.md), [customizing runtime settings](docs/tutorials/customize_runtime.md) and [useful tools](docs/useful_tools.md).

Please refer to [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for frequently asked questions.
